    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello visitors! I have always introduced myself as a chemist or forensic scientist in the past because of my career choice and my background in science but now I am pursuing a career in the software development world with an urge to learn more about this field so now I will introduce myself just as Araceli. I have graduated from the University of Texas from San Antonio with a B.A. in Chemistry and B.S. in Biochemistry. I've worked as a chemist for a Biochemistry research at alma mater and then later on as a Forensic Scientist for a state government agency.</p>
